# Light & Layers Portfolio 

Welcome to my personal design and photography portfolio website. This project is a showcase of my creative and technical skills, built with love using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. It features my photography, design work, and a little about me 

# My Process & Challenges 

I started with my Figma mockups from the User Experience Design course as a reference to build a fully responsive and accessible portfolio using Bootstrap.

Throughout the process, I:
- Customized Bootstrap with my own CSS variables to match my brand style 
- Made sure everything was responsive and worked on all devices 
- Focused on visual storytelling through smooth layouts and image-based sections 


# Challenges I Faced:
- Linking different types of work in a consistent way
- Making custom layouts feel unique while still using Bootstrap's grid system
- Ensuring cross-device compatibility and consistent styling across pages

# What I Learned 
Creating this portfolio helped me level up my skills in:

- Structuring a multi-page responsive website using Bootstrap 
- Writing clean, reusable CSS with variables 
- Building accessible layouts and components 
- Publishing and managing a live site using GitHub Pages 
- Organizing my design and development work into a cohesive user experience 

This project also gave me more confidence in showcasing my personal style and voice through code and visuals
